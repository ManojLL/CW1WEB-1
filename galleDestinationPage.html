            <div class="arti" style="width: 70%;"><p>Galle provides an outstanding example of an urban ensemble which
                illustrates the interaction of European architecture and South Asian traditions from the 16th to the
                19th centuries. The most salient feature is the use of European models adapted by local manpower to the
                geological, climatic, historical, and cultural conditions of Sri Lanka.
                In the structure of the ramparts, coral is frequently used along with granite. In the ground layout all
                the measures of length, width and height conform with the regional metrology.
                The wide streets, planted with grass and shaded by suriyas, are lined with houses, each with its own
                garden and an open veranda supported by columns, another sign of the acculturation of an architecture
                which is European only in its basic design.
                <br><br>
                The fort of Galle was handed over to the English only on 23 February 1796, one week after the surrender
                of Colombo. As a British protectorate, Galle remained the administrative centre of the south of Ceylon.
                A number of unfortunate modifications were then made: ditches filled in, new blockhouses added, a gate
                put in between the Moon bastion and the Sun bastion, a lighthouse installed on the Utrecht bastion, and
                a tower erected for the jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1883.
                Other work was undertaken during the Second World War in order to restore the defensive function of the
                fortifications.

            <div class="title"><h3>Kanneliya Rain Forest </h3></div>
            <div class="arti"><p>Kanneliya-Dediyagala-Nakiyadeniya, or KDN, is a forest reserve in the Southern Province
                of Sri Lanka.
                Identified as one of the most floristically rich areas in South Asia; this forest region is the last
                remaining large rainforest in Sri Lanka,
                other than the Sinharaja Rainforest. The forest is situated 35km northwest of the City of Galle; and is
                a major catchment area for two of the most important rivers in southern Sri Lanka,
                Gin Ganga and Nilwala Ganga. Designated as a biosphere reserve in 2004 by UNESCO, the Kanneliya forest
                reserve home to many endemic plant and animal species.
                <br><br>
                Visitors to Kanneliya should first visit the Forestry Department building housed within the jungle. The
                building also has a dormitory with bunkbeds, where visitors can choose to stay overnight. They also
                provide traditional meals in the cafeteria made from fresh local produce. So spending a whole day
                looking at the attractions is a good idea too.

                The Kanneliya Rainforest has many beautiful sights to see. But key amongst these are four of them.
                The Anagimale Falls is an extremely attractive white cascade bounding over a number of large rocks
                strewn around the stream bed,
                and is just 2km from the gate on a broad trail. This makes it very accessible. The streams lost most of
                their water retaining capabilities due to de-forestation in the 70s and 80s,
                an therefore the true beauty of these waterfalls are rarely seen today. However, the situation is
                improving as the forest recoversthe delicate balance of nature, which was once disturbed.
                Walking 200m further down the main trailfrom the Anagimale Falls, one can reach the giant creeper. This
                is an ancient twisted creeper almost the height of a person, and is one of the wonders of Kanneliya.
